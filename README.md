# AboutMe
This is a project about some information about me. For the user to get to know me better.
Added a pargraph, an unordered list and an ordered list. To help talking about myself to the user.
I also added some fun questions, a guessing game to know more about me in a more fun way than just paragraphs.
Last two questions depended on loops and arrays.
We collaborated to edit the questions of the guessing game, to make them all based on functions, my partner was Bader Al-Shawabkeh.
